# cpp-python-extending-embedding
Prototyping: Embed Python in C++ and extend Python to call C++ modules simultaneously

## Description
The code demonstrates how to embed Python into C++ and how to extend Python with C++ simultaneously
* Embedding: Calling Python interpreter from C++
* Extending: Calling a C++ module from Python

Note that now every Python package can be imported to embedded Python, and they may cause crashes.
